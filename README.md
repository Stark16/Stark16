### 🔍 **[Experimenting with Hebbian Learning for Object Detection](https://github.com/Stark16/Hebbian_Object_Detection)**  🔍

**About:**  
This project explores an alternative approach to object detection by integrating **Hebbian Learning** principles into a deep learning framework. Inspired by the **[HebbNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9414241)** paper, which demonstrated Hebbian Learning for MNIST digit classification, this research extends the concept to object detection. The primary goal is to evaluate whether this approach enables **faster learning** compared to conventional **Gradient-Based Backpropagation**.  

**🛠 Technologies Used:**  
`Detectron2` `Python` `Hugging Face` `HebbNet`

**📌 Status:** Pending Further Improvements 🔄
